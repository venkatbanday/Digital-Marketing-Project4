# Digital-Marketing-Project4
Building Integrated Selling Strategy
Retrospect, metrics
Once you define the selling strategy, decide on the communication plan, and reach out to your prospects, you need to retrospect and find out what has worked well and what hasn't. This gives you a good insight into customer psychology and helps you streamline your strategy to get better results.
This project will help you define your key performance indicators (KPIs), retrospect your digital selling and communication plan, identify improvement areas, and come up with a better plan.
